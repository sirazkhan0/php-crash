<!-- What are different types of HTTP methods?
POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are the most regularly used HTTP methods. These methods relate to the CRUD (create,
read, update, and delete) activities. -->


<!-- What are HTTP methods used for?
HTTP specifies a variety of request methods for specifying the desired action for a particular resource. These request
methods are commonly referred to be HTTP verbs, despite the fact that they can also be nouns. -->

<!-- How many HTTP methods are there?
Methods are like the alphabet in the API development world: they're commonly used but rarely thought about. The official HTTP Request Method registry includes 39 total HTTP verbs, each giving a method for sophisticated interactions. Most API developers only utilise GET, PUT, or POST, yet the official HTTP Request Method registry lists 39 total HTTP verbs.

What are three well known methods of verbs in HTTP?
POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are the most often used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are officially known). Create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) actions are represented by these letters. -->

<!-- What is header in HTTP?
HTTP headers allow the client and server to send extra data with an HTTP request or response. The name of an HTTP header is case-insensitive, followed by a colon (:), and then the value. The value is ignored if there is any whitespace before it. -->
